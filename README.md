### 2. Setting Up Environment Variables

#### Steps:
1. **Create an `env.py` File:**

   - Import the `os` module in this file.

2. **Define Environment Variables:**
   - Set up the necessary variables, such as the secret key and database URL, in `env.py`.

3. **Update `settings.py`:**

4. **Configure Variables on Heroku:**
   - Navigate to the **"Settings"** tab of your Heroku app.
   - Under **"Config Vars"**, add the same variables from your `env.py` file.

5. **Database Migration:**

2. **Commit and Push:**
   - Use Git to stage, commit, and push your changes to the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
     git push origin main
     ```
